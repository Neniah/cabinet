        %p In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients
        corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not
        being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day
        of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content,
        say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to
        focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text
        risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate
        environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early
        1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.
